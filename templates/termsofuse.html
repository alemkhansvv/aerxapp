            Entire Agreement. The Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and AERX and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and AERX with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other AERX services, affiliate services, third-party content, or third-party software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Choice of Law and Forum. The Terms of Use and the relationship between you and AERX shall be governed by the laws of Kazakhstan without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and AERX agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Kazakhstan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of AERX to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Statute of Limitations. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
